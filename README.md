## Overall objective

This project will investigate how to use Machine Learning Operations tools on a project. Specifically, we work with the [Google QUEST Q&A Labeling](https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-quest-challenge) competition from Kaggle.

## Framework

In this project we intend to use the Transformers framework, which provides an array of pre-trained models,
for various uses such as for instance text, vision and audio. We will in this project work with text data in
order to classify movie-ratings from IMDB, hence the reason for exploiting such framework.
We will more specifically employ the model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations From Transformers) 
developed by Google, which is a transformer-based machine-learning model for Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Data

The data is found in the [Huggingface Datasets library](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/) and consists of Imdb ratings. They have provided 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. They also include an unlabelled version of the data. Specifically, the dataset contains a â€˜textâ€™ column, which is a string of the written review in itself, and a â€˜labelâ€™ column with possible values 0 and 1, describing whether it is a negative or positive review, respectively.
